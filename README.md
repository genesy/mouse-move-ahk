# Vim mouse AHK

Inspired by a mouse movement setting on macOS' old karabiner app. I haven't used a mac in a while so I don't remember the exact keybinds it used. Edited some of it for my convenience

## Instructions

### Activation
  1. Press `k` then `d` within 80ms of each other
  2. Release `k` but keep `d` held
  3. use `h` `j` `k` `l` keys to move cursor

### Other mouse movement

  * Holding `s` will increase cursor speed
  * Holding `x` will use mouse wheel for `hjkl`
  * `f` is left click
  * `v` is right click
  * `g` is middle click


## To do
  1. Add indicator when mouse mode is on
  2. Find a better activation method
  3. Make UI to edit variables
